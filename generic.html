					<h3>Terms And Conditions</h3>
					<p>
						By downloading or using the app, these terms will
						automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
						that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
						allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
						our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
						extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
						to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
						versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
						database rights and other intellectual property rights related
						to it, still belong to Charles Baillargeon.
					</p>
					<p>
						Charles Baillargeon is committed to ensuring that the app is
						as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
						reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
						its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
						charge you for the app or its services without making it very
						clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Betasnap app stores and processes personal data that
						you have provided to us, in order to provide my
						Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
						access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
						not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
						removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
						official operating system of your device. It could make your
						phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
						compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
						that the Betasnap app won’t work properly or at all.
					</p>
					<div>
						<p>
							The app does use third party services that declare their own
							Terms and Conditions.

					<p>
						You should be aware that there are certain things that
						Charles Baillargeon will not take responsibility for. Certain
						functions of the app will require the app to have an active
						internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
						by your mobile network provider, but Charles Baillargeon
						cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
						functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
						have any of your data allowance left.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
						should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
						mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
						be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
						the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
						other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
						responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
						charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
						(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
						you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
						using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
						received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
					</p>
					<p>
						Along the same lines, Charles Baillargeon cannot always take
						responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
						make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
						battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
						Charles Baillargeon cannot accept responsibility.
					</p>
					<p>
						With respect to Charles Baillargeon’s responsibility for your
						use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
						bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
						updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
						to provide information to us so that we can make it available
						to you. Charles Baillargeon accepts no liability for any
						loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
						relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
					</p>
					<p>
						At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
						currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
						both systems(and for any additional systems we
						decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
						and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
						using the app. Charles Baillargeon does not promise that it
						will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
						and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
						installed on your device. However, you promise to always
						accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
						also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
						it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
						Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
						rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
						(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
						from your device.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Applicable Law And Jurisdiction</strong></p>
					<p>
						The Mobile Application can be accessed from all countries around
						the world where the local technology permits. As each of these places
						have differing laws, by accessing the Mobile Application both you and
						we agree that the laws of Canada, without regard to
						the conflicts of laws principles thereof, will apply to all matters
						relating to the use of the Mobile Application.

						You accept and agree that both you and we shall submit to the exclusive
						jurisdiction of the courts of Canada in respect of any
						dispute arising out of and/or in connection with these Terms and Conditions of Use.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Your Interactions with Other Users</strong></p>
					<p>
						Betasnap is not responsible
						for the conduct of any user on or off of the Service. You agree to use
						caution in all interactions with other users, particularly if you decide
						to communicate off the Service or meet in person. You agree that you will
						not provide your financial information (for example,
						your credit card or bank account information) to other users.
					</p>
					<p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. YOU UNDERSTAND
						THAT BETASNAP DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE
						INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. BETASNAP MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
						WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF USERS.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
					<p>
						I may update our Terms and Conditions
						from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
						periodically for any changes. I will
						notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
						Conditions on this page.
					</p>
					<p>
						These terms and conditions are effective as of 2020-05-07
					</p>

						If you have any questions or suggestions about my
						Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact me
